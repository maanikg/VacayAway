About the project:
- The app take in a user's destination preference and length of trip and generates a full itinerary
- Identifies the cheapest flight path given the selected destination and dates by using `LufthansaAPI` and `AmadeusAPI`
- Finds the ideal hotel and attractions based on duration of stay in the chosen destination using the Google Maps `PlacesAPI`
- Groups attractions by day based on relative location of all attractions using `TensorFlow` k-means grouping

The process:
- Implemented the frontend of the app using `ReactJS`
- Managed user authentication and established storage of user-associated itineraries with `Firebase` Authentication and Realtime Database
- Integrated Google Maps into the app, allowing for the user to see attractions in the city and their proximity to airport, hotel, each other, etc. via a map interface
- Set up the `AmadeusAPI` and `LufthansaAPI` calls to find the cheapest flights in the browser environment and throttled their usage to obey rate limits
- Utilized Google Maps `PlacesAPI` to generate attractions for a trip
- Grouping attractions by location using `TensorFlow` to generate a logical order of events **(CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS üîú)**

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you want to fork or duplicate this repo, you must make a Google Cloud Project account, AmadeusAPI account, and LufthansaAPI account and replace the api keys in a .env file as they are referenced in the code. The program will not work correctly otherwise as API calls won't be made unless the API keys are valid.
